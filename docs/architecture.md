# Architecture

`servef` is one product implemented by two build-time projects and distributed
as one Go binary.

## System boundaries

- `main.go` and `cmd/`: CLI, process lifecycle, listener, browser launch.
- `internal/files/`: Markdown discovery and safe path resolution.
- `internal/features/`: startup feature configuration.
- `internal/web/`: HTTP API, Markdown rendering, shell/static delivery, embedded assets.
- `web/`: React UI, Vite build, frontend tests and development tooling.
- `testdata/markdown/`: canonical filesystem corpus for Go and browser tests.
- `testdata/api/`: transport scenarios for frontend-only development.
- `tests/browser/`: browser tests across the Go/React boundary.

The filesystem root passed to the CLI is the primary runtime trust boundary.
The server indexes permitted Markdown paths and resolves requests only through
that index. It currently binds all IPv4 interfaces, so adding mutations or
sensitive state requires an explicit network/authentication decision.

## Dependency direction

```text
CLI -> HTTP application -> files/features/metrics
React -> HTTP API -> HTTP application
web source -> Vite -> internal/web/dist -> go:embed -> servef binary
```

Go and pnpm retain their native dependency graphs. The repository-level
`package.json` is a command facade; `web/package.json` owns browser dependencies.
Add another Go module or pnpm package only for an independently consumed unit.

## Development and tests

- `pnpm dev`: Go over `testdata/markdown` plus Vite with API proxying.
- `pnpm dev:mock`: Vite plus committed JSON fixtures; no Go process.
- `go test ./...`: Go unit and HTTP integration behavior.
- `pnpm test:web`: frontend logic and fixture-contract behavior.
- `pnpm test:browser`: production bootstrap and end-to-end behavior.

## Distribution

Vite writes hashed assets to `internal/web/dist`. The generated directory is
committed so `go install github.com/flexdinesh/servef@latest` needs no JavaScript
toolchain. CI rebuilds it and fails if committed output is stale. Installed
releases contain no Node.js runtime or frontend sidecar.

## Growth rules

1. Organize Go around capabilities before adding abstraction layers.
2. Keep HTTP DTOs at the transport boundary; move document/search behavior out
   of `internal/web` as those capabilities grow.
3. Keep browser contracts runtime-validated. Introduce OpenAPI and generated
   client types when manual contract maintenance becomes material.
4. Create shared frontend packages only after a second consumer exists.
5. Add task-graph caching only when multiple projects or CI timings justify it.
